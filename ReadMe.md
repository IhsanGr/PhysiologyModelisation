**Physiology project about diabetics rats**  
In this project, the objective was to study the regulation of blood sugar levels (the concentration of glucose in the blood) following an oral intake of glucose.  
To do so we modelized this regulation by a system of differential equations and tried to find the best parameters to fit the data.  
Then with the analysis of these parameters values of rats in different conditions (diabetics or not) we determined which parameter was the most important in glucose regulation. And in fact which process seems to be the most important for it.
